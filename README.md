## **Introduce project :**

The interior of the large building is very spacious and there are many roads, so it’s not easy to get to the desired location. The building may have a map, but you can’t memorize each one.

So, to relieve this inconvenience, we made an indoor AR navigation system. It can be used anywhere 3D modeling is prepared.!


## **Goal :**

## **environment :**
Unity `2021.1.5f1`   
ARCore XR `4.2.2`   
AR Foundation `4.2.2`   
AT+ Explore `1.4.9f3`   
SketchUp   

## **Requirements and supported device :**
Our project is using ARcore package to show AR environment within Unity. That's why you need to use a device that supports ARCore.

### **Android)**   
Android 8.1 (API 27) or later is required.   
- The rear (world) camera is emulated as a virtual scene.
- Front (selfie) cameras are not supported.

### **iOS)**   
The current project is based on Android, but the Unity project settings allow you to add an iOS experience.   
The device must support ARKit. Lowest possible deployment target is iOS 12.0, but latest iOS 14.0 is strongly recommended.

## **3D modeling :**
